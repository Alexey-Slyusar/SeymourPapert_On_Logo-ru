In 1986 Seymour Papert, the "father of Logo," collaborated with award-winning filmmaker William Schwartz and Elizabeth Schwartz, who was Assistant Superintendent of the Ladue, Missouri School District, to produce Seymour Papert On Logo.



In this video series, Papert shares his vision of thinking, learning, and teaching in a computer culture, and also addresses technical issues about Logo and programming more generally. 

Seymour Papert On Logo offers a window into a time when computers and Logo had been in widespread use in schools for just a few years, while also delving into issues about computing and education that remain relevant today.

The 10 videos in the series are now being made available here on the Logo Foundation website for your personal and educational use under the terms of use specified below.

The Seymour Papert On Logo video series has two parts:

    New Mindstorms focuses on the process and the principles of learning.
    Logo Hurdles is about specific technical aspects of Logo.

An additional component, On LogoWriter, looks at that specific version of Logo, which was developed by Logo Computer Systems Inc (LCSI) and had just been released in 1985.
